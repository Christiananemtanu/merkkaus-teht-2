            <h4>The Road to Enlightenment</h4>
            <div>
                <p> Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs and broken CSS support.</p>
                <p>Today, we must clear the mind of the past practices.
                Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts 
                of folk like the W3C, WASP and the major browser creators</p>
                <p>The css Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons 
                of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. 
                Learn to use the (yet to be) time-honoured techniques in the new and invigorating
                fashion. Become one with the web</p>
            <h4 class="sub-header">So What is This About?</h5> <hr class="p1">
                <p>There is clearly a need for CSS to be taken seriously by graph artists. The Zen Garden 
                aims to excite, inspire and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the exiting designs in the list. Clicking 
                on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, 
                the only thing that changed is the external .css file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. 
                The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by 
                demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. 
                To date, most examples of neat tricks and hacks have been demonstrated by structurists and coders. 
                Designers have yet to make their mark. This needs to change. </p>
            <h4 class="sub-header">Participation</h5> <hr class="p1">
                <p>Graphic artists only please. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary,
                but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. 
                Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>
                <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting 
                at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
                <p>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece 
                (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control.
                Send us a link to the file and if we choose to use it, we will spider the associated images. Final 
                submissions will be placed on our server. </p>
